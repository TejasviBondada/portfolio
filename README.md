AI Tool Used:
  I used Bolt.new to generate an initial starter template.

What I Changed Manually:
  After generating the base template using the AI tool:

    1. Improved the layout and responsiveness (media queries)
    2. Added a real mobile navigation menu with JavaScript
    3. Created the 3-column → 2-column → 1-column Skills grid
    4. Added animations (CSS fade-in + hover lift effect)
    5. Chose a custom blue/white color theme
    6. Rewrote and cleaned up the HTML structure
    7. Improved accessibility & semantic tags
